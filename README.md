# iClinic MiniChallenge

This project was built to satisfy a [iClinic's weather mini challenge](https://github.com/iclinic/weather-mini-challenge).

It was built using Python 3.7 and Flask.
The challenge was to get the weather forecast for the week and show a message in case it might rain in one of the next 5 days.
I used OpenWeatherMap's 5 day weather forecast API to accomplish this task.
